# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

A modern, responsive, and visually appealing personal portfolio website built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** only.

- 🎨 Modern color palette (dark blue, cyan, purple accents)

- 🚫 No frameworks — pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – semantic and accessible structure  
- **CSS3** – Flexbox, Grid, animations, glassmorphism effects  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – interactivity and dynamic behavior
